            <h1>Ben & Jerry's Case File</h1>
            
            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>This case study is to analyze the potential take over of Ben & Jerry’s. Ben & Jerry’s is a corporation founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield out of a Gas Station in Vermont in 1978 in Vermont. The company is known for its community oriented behaviors and mission, and its homemade high quality but affordable ice cream that virtually anyone can afford. The company is an industry leader with sales in the 237 million dollar range. The company has a three-pronged mission dedicated to prioritizing quality of product, economic affordability, and social responsibility. The business has a dual class stock structure with different voting rights depending on the class. The supportive state law also allows for considerations of non-financial factors in acquisition decisions.</p>
            <p>	Once the company started facing declining profits, takeover was on the table. The company had started receiving takeover offers from companies like Unilever. The board was divided on how to proceed.The Co-founders Ben and Jerry wanted to continue doing what was best for the community but the board wanted to do what was best for the shareholders. Four potential bidders had offers on the table, Unilever, Dreyer’s, Meadowbrook Lane Capital, and Chartwell Investments each with advantages and drawbacks. The case evaluates against the companies financial performance and social mission and each takeover offer.</p>
            
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>The problem faced by Ben and Jerry’s is to accept an offer or not and if they accept an offer which one to accept. All of this needed to be done while maximizing financial returns for shareholders and continuing operations, and preserving the company’s unique social mission and independence.</p>
            
            <h2>Recommendation and Analysis</h2>
            <p>	Ben and Jerrys should accept Unilever’s $36 dollars a share offer for all cash. They should accept this offer because it’s the highest cash premium for shareholders at $36 a share. This is higher than the pre-trading price of $26 a share. This offers a 71% premium. This also surpasses all the other bids. This addresses the board's duty to maximize shareholder value given the company’s financial decline. The company has had a low ROE since 1999 with just 7% return on shareholders equity which was up from 5% in 1997. The industry ROE was around 15% so Ben and Jerry’s was doing poorly. The higher investment by Unilever provides a high premium compensating shareholders for years of poor performance.</p>
            <p>	Unilever Is the largest ice cream producer in the world. Their already established supply chain could benefit Ben and Jerry’s efficiency. The acquisition of Ben and Jerry’s would allow the company access to resources and market reach it previously had no access to.</p>
            <p>	There were also problems with alternate bids. Dreyer’s 31dollars a share was a stock for stock deal not a cash deal. They also pledged to maintain existing management. The offer price is significantly lower than Unilever’s and would expose stockholders to market risks. Meadowbrook Lane capital offered $32 a share in cash and is still below Unilever’s offer. This company would likely prioritize its own mission and financial performance over the community which is the opposite of Ben and Jerry’s goal. They also want to risk the company culture by appointing a new management team. Chartwell Investments' offer was not a viable solution for shareholders seeking an immediate exit. This also would lead to installation of a new management team and jeopardize the company's social mission.</p>
            <p>	The Unilever offer is the most value and straight forward comprehensive offer and is in my opinion a no brainer offer to accept. Cash, a higher cash offer than any other competitors, the management team gets to stay the same preserving the company’s culture. It is financially beneficial to the shareholders, fulfills the primary economic objective of the company’s mission statement, which is to operate on a sound financial basis and increase shareholders value.</p>
            
            <h2>Alternative Solutions</h2>
            <p>	They could have accepted Dreyer’s offer as an alternative. This would preserve the autonomy of the company, Dreyer’s is community oriented, the delivery system of Dreyer’s which is direct to store would be a good fit for ben and jerry’s. The drawbacks are that there would be a lower financial return of $31 per share and the offer is a stock for stock deal not a cash deal.</p>
            
            <h2>Other General Notes</h2>
			<p>	I did not submit a spreadsheet because I feel that all the relevant and needed information was included within the executive summary problem statement and recommendation and analysis as well as the alternate solutions sections.</p>
