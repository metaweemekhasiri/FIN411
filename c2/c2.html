            <h1>UPS v. FedEx Case File</h1>
            
            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>This case examines the rivalry between UPS and Fedex. They are both package delivery companies founded in The United States and trying to branch out into the rapidly changing world market which is being influenced heavily by the rise of e-commerce. This document provides an overview of each company’s history, as well as their acquisitions or attempted acquisitions in the case of UPS and a rivalry of constant one-up-manship. This document also provides documents on their financial performance up to 2015 highlighting their equal and non-equal or contrasted approaches. The core issue is their financial health and operational health as new market dynamics and strategies are adopted and competition gets more cut throat.</p>
            
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>The main problem is figuring out which company of the two is better positioned for future success in the ever changing and evolving package delivery market for investors and whether or not their current performance has a basis in future financial performance.</p>
            
            <h2>Recommendation and Analysis</h2>
            <p>Based on the Analysis UPS is better positioned for future success over it’s competitor FedEx. This is backed up by UPS financial performance, efficiency, and strategic positioning in key areas of growth. UPS has consistently outperformed FedEx in  several key profitability metrics in 2015. UPS had a net profit of nearly $5 billion  on $58 billion on revenues contrasted with FedEx with a net income of slightly over $1 billion on revenues of about $48 billion.

            <h2>Alternative Solutions</h2>
            <p>The acquisition of TNT Express could be an alternative solution for FedEx This bolstered FedEx’s presence in Europe with a strong road network which is where FedEx previously struggled to compete with UPS. This could significantly improve FedEx’s chances over UPS in Europe.</p>
